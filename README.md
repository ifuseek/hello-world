# hello-world
It's about time I started my git-hub space
I'm an old school coder from way back in the day.
Remember gopher? .files? Yup, I do.  I created many of those long before the internet was public.
I moved forward from there and built nike.com, from the ground up all the way through to the first e-commerce transaction.
I don't code much anymore.  However, getting my need-to-know knowledge spiffed up.

Back in the day, svn was the only game in town.  Looking forward to getting "learned up" on Git.
